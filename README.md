**File structure:** <br />
EdgePreserving-Blur/ <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data/ <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input/ <br />

Before run the code,  <br />
1) put input images in `data/input`, and edit the input path in `run.sh`  <br />
2) you should have opencv installed <br />
3) you should have Matlab installed, and add its path to `$PATH`  <br />
(for me, it's like `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014a/bin`)  <br />
  
To run the code, first `make` to compile the EdgePreservedBlur.cpp file.  <br />
Then, simply `sh run.sh` to run the program.  <br />

**My building environment**<br />
Ubuntu 14.04<br />
opencv 3.2.0<br />

FYI, I also wrote a program in pure c++ (that is, not like the cpp-matlab mixed way here),  <br />
and I used Eigen for solving Ax=b.  <br />
However, the performance was much worse than pure matlab codes!  <br />
(I'll report the running time later)  <br /><br />
So, my final decision is to convert between c++ and matlab,  <br />
and let c++ handle the for loops and have matlab responsible for solving the linear system.  <br />
The program is much faster than pure matlab :D <br />
(for a 2048\*1080 image, cpp+matlab: 7min, matlab: 22min)  <br />
